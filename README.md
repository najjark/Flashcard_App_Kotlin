# Kotlin Flashcard App

This Kotlin app allows users to create, review, and automatically generate flashcards.

It allows users to manually create flashcards, or generate them automatically either for a topic they enter or a random topic.

# API Key Setup

The app uses an OpenAI API key to generate the questions and answers for the flashcards.
You will need to use your own OpenAI API key on Line 17 of the 'LLMApiClient.kt' file.
